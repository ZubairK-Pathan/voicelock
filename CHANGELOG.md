## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added automated test suite in `tests/test_api.py` with 20 comprehensive unit, integration, and security edge case tests.
- Added upfront `Content-Length` header verification in `save_upload()` to reject oversized payloads prior to reading request bodies.
- Added defensive configuration loaders `load_server_threshold()` and `load_max_audio_size()` with bounds checking and safe fallbacks.
- Added tests verifying decision tamper resistance (client threshold parameter cannot bypass denial for low similarity audio).
- Added tests verifying `predict_speaker` and `verify_speaker` raise typed `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`.
- Added `pytest` and `httpx` to `requirements.txt`.
- Created `.env.example` with sanitized environment configuration template.
- Added comprehensive handoff documentation suite (`AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).

### Fixed
- Fixed unhandled audio decoding errors (`soundfile.LibsndfileError`, FFmpeg conversion failures) by mapping them to HTTP 400 Bad Request instead of internal server errors.
- Fixed process termination in `predict.py` by replacing `sys.exit(1)` with `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`.
- Fixed `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'values'` in `tune_threshold.py`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent tracking of `firebase-credentials.json`, `.env`, and private key files.

### Security
- Enforced server-side calibrated threshold (`SERVER_THRESHOLD = 0.25`) in `cloud_api.py`, ignoring and rejecting client threshold tampering.
- Implemented `MAX_AUDIO_SIZE_BYTES` (10MB) upload ceiling with HTTP 413 rejection and early `Content-Length` rejection.
- Enforced audio extension whitelisting (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.aac`).
- Added guaranteed temporary file cleanup via `try/finally` across success, client disconnect, and error paths.
- Sanitized API error details to prevent leaking internal filesystem paths or stack traces.
- Isolated `firebase-credentials.json` on local filesystem and added rules preventing Git inclusion.
