## 1. Executive Status
Milestone 3A (Authentication Design and Security Review) has completed an in-depth security audit of the API surface, categorized 11 vulnerabilities ranked by severity, and established the declarative authentication and authorization architecture for VoiceLock Enterprise. The security model explicitly decouples three distinct identity domains: human Web Users (`IdentityType.WEB_USER`, authenticated via Firebase RS256 JWTs), passive Biometric Voiceprints (`IdentityType.SPEAKER_VOICE`, verified via 192-d ECAPA-TDNN embeddings and liveness), and IoT Hardware Terminals (`IdentityType.IOT_DEVICE`, authenticated via pre-shared secret keys / HMAC tokens). A new declarative access policy module (`app/core/auth_policy.py`) defines a formal Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) matrix across `Admin`, `User`, `Device`, and `Anonymous` roles with dedicated unit test coverage. The automated test suite has expanded to 42 passing tests with zero regressions on the Streamlit reference application or SpeechBrain ML pipeline.

## 2. Completed Milestones

### Milestone 0: Baseline Audit (Completed)
- Inspected full repository tree, commit history, and stash contents.
- Verified local runtime: Python 3.14.7, FFmpeg 8.1.2, Node.js v25.9.0.
- Audited ML models: ECAPA-TDNN (192-d vectors, CPU inference ~1.5s), 12 enrolled profiles.
- Verified baseline accuracy: 100% on held-out test sentences (Advait, Omar, Parth).
- Discovered and diagnosed `AttributeError` in `tune_threshold.py`.
- Identified security risks in `cloud_api.py`.

### Milestone 1: Safe Foundation & Security Baseline (Completed)
- Safely reverted unpushed local commit `310e8df` via `git reset --soft HEAD~1` without deleting or modifying local files.
- Verified `firebase-credentials.json` is physically preserved on disk, untracked, and ignored by Git.
- Created `feature/enterprise-foundation` branch rooted at `9587b59`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent tracking of `firebase-credentials.json`, `.env*`, and private keys.
- Generated sanitized `.env.example` template with non-secret placeholders.
- Applied minimal bugfix to `tune_threshold.py` (resolving `all_embeddings.values()` crash).
- Audited statistical validity of EER threshold calculation (ADR 002 in `DECISIONS.md`).
- Established shared handoff documentation framework (7 files).

### Milestone 2A: Test Foundation & API Hardening (Completed)
- Installed `pytest` in `.venv` and updated `requirements.txt`.
- Built comprehensive automated test suite in `tests/test_api.py` covering health, listing, integration, missing audio, empty payloads, unsupported extensions, oversized payloads, threshold override resistance, empty profiles, and temp-file cleanup.
- Replaced `sys.exit()` in `predict.py` with `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`, while wrapping CLI `main()` with clean error handling.
- Hardened `cloud_api.py`:
  - Enforced server-controlled threshold `SERVER_THRESHOLD = 0.25` (ignoring/disallowing client threshold tampering).
  - Enforced `MAX_AUDIO_SIZE_BYTES = 10MB` with HTTP 413 rejection.
  - Added extension whitelist validation (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.aac`).
  - Added robust chunked temp file writing and guaranteed `try/finally` cleanup on success, client disconnect, and error.
  - Sanitized error responses to prevent leaking internal filesystem paths or stack traces.
- Verified zero regressions on `evaluate.py`, `tune_threshold.py`, `predict.py`, and `app.py` (Streamlit AppTest).

### Milestone 2A.1: Security Review & Verification (Completed)
- **Review A (Upload Security):** Upfront `Content-Length` header inspection and 64KB chunked spooling. Unreadable audio mapped to HTTP 400.
- **Review B (Threshold Configuration):** Defensive `load_server_threshold()` and `load_max_audio_size()` bounded parsers. Tamper resistance verified.
- **Review C (API Test Quality):** Expanded tests from 13 to 20, verifying real security boundaries and temp-file lifecycle.
- **Review D (Error Handling & Regression):** Typed exceptions in `predict.py` verified; zero ML or UI regressions.

### Milestone 2B: Stateful Liveness Hardening (Completed)
- **Architecture & Interface:**
  - Defined `BaseChallengeStore` ABC with `create_challenge`, `get_challenge`, `validate_and_consume`, and `cleanup_expired`.
  - Implemented `InMemoryChallengeStore` using `threading.Lock` and injectable `time_func` clock abstraction for deterministic testing.
- **Lifecycle & Security Semantics:**
  - CSPRNG digit sequence generation (`secrets.randbelow(10)`) and 128-bit random challenge IDs (`secrets.token_hex(16)`).
  - Strict 60-second Time-to-Live (TTL).
  - Single-Attempt Invalidation ('burn-on-use') — challenge transitions to `CONSUMED` immediately on verification initiation, defeating replay attacks and concurrent duplicate submissions.
  - Session and speaker binding: challenges are strictly bound to a `session_id` and optional `claimed_identity`.
  - Fail-closed execution: liveness failures (wrong digits, silence, transcription failure) deny access and skip SpeechBrain ML inference.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /challenge`: Generates challenge with metadata; supports both JSON and Form payloads.
  - `POST /verify`: Requires `challenge_id` and `session_id`, enforces liveness passing before executing biometric verification.
- **Automated Tests:**
  - Expanded test suite from 20 to 34 automated tests, including race-condition testing across 10 concurrent threads, clock-injected expiry, and tamper resistance.
- **Streamlit Compatibility:**
  - Preserved backward-compatible function signatures in `liveness.py`, ensuring `app.py` runs with zero modifications.

### Milestone 2C: Security Review & Incremental API Modularization (Completed)
- **Early Challenge Invalidation Before Upload Processing:**
  - Reordered verification pipeline in `POST /verify`: atomically validates and consumes the challenge *before* calling `save_upload()`, preventing disk writes and buffering exhaustion from unauthorized, expired, or mismatched tokens.
  - Added automated test `test_verify_invalid_challenge_rejects_before_saving_upload`.
- **Modular Package Architecture (`app/`):**
  - `app/core/`: Centralized configuration (`config.py`) and typed error helpers (`errors.py`).
  - `app/schemas/`: Pydantic validation models for challenges (`challenge.py`) and verification/speakers/health (`verification.py`).
  - `app/services/`: Service layer isolating model caching (`speaker_service.py`), challenge operations (`challenge_service.py`), and chunked audio streaming (`verification_service.py`).
  - `app/api/`: Sub-routers for `routes_health.py`, `routes_speakers.py`, `routes_challenges.py`, and `routes_verification.py`.
  - `app/main.py`: Application factory (`create_app`) with modern FastAPI `lifespan` handler replacing deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")`.
- **Backward-Compatible Entry Point (`cloud_api.py`):**
  - Preserved `cloud_api.py` as a transparent root entry point re-exporting all symbols for CLI commands (`uvicorn cloud_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`) and integrations.
  - Implemented dynamic accessor lookup pattern in route controllers to seamlessly support `unittest.mock.patch("cloud_api.*")` without circular imports.
- **Verification & Zero Regressions:**
  - All 35 tests in `tests/test_api.py` pass cleanly in 1.2s.
  - Streamlit `app.py` AppTest passes with zero crashes.
  - ML inference, evaluation (27/27 correct, 100% accuracy), and threshold calibration execute successfully.

### Milestone 3A: Authentication Design & Security Review (Completed)
- **Comprehensive Threat Audit:** Identified 11 security findings ranked from Critical to Low:
  - Critical: Unauthenticated endpoints, user enumeration via `/speakers` & `/challenge`, and compute engine DoS via unconstrained ML inference.
  - High: Starlette multipart memory/disk buffering prior to route handler entry, unconstrained WebSocket frame ingestion, and in-memory challenge store memory limits.
  - Medium: Permissive CORS wildcard origins with credentials, public metric exposure in `/`, small EER sample size (27 recordings/3 speakers), and voice deepfake boundaries.
  - Low: Non-standard dynamic lookup adapter in routes.
- **Identity Decoupling:** Formally separated `IdentityType.WEB_USER` (Firebase JWT), `IdentityType.IOT_DEVICE` (Pre-Shared Key), and `IdentityType.SPEAKER_VOICE` (Passive 192-d biometric).
- **Declarative Access Policy Module:** Created `app/core/auth_policy.py` defining `Role`, `Permission`, and `ENDPOINT_POLICIES` matrix.
- **Automated Policy Tests:** Added `tests/test_auth_policy.py` (7 tests), expanding the test suite to 42 passing tests.
- **Documentation Updates:** Comprehensive updates to `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `DECISIONS.md` (ADR 006), and `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## 4. Known Issues & Remaining Security Risks
1. **API Endpoints Remain Unauthenticated in Working Tree:**
   - *Status:* Milestone 3A established the design and policy framework; live enforcement middleware is scheduled for Milestone 3B.
   - *Action:* Keep API private to local development until Milestone 3B authentication is applied.
2. **Multipart Buffering in Starlette:**
   - *Risk:* Starlette buffers multipart payloads before route handlers execute. An attacker omitting `Content-Length` can force disk writes.
   - *Plan:* Add ASGI raw stream size limiter middleware in Milestone 3B.
3. **In-Memory Challenge Store Single-Process Boundary:**
   - *Risk:* `InMemoryChallengeStore` is local to a single Python process. Running Uvicorn with `--workers > 1` causes state divergence.
   - *Plan:* Replace with Redis or PostgreSQL challenge store conforming to `BaseChallengeStore` in Milestone 3C.
4. **Small Evaluation Dataset & Threshold Discordance:**
   - *Risk:* 0.00% EER is computed on only 3 speakers (27 test samples). Max impostor score of 0.6802 exceeds baseline threshold of 0.25.
   - *Plan:* Retain 0.25 for prototype compatibility; conduct comprehensive multi-session biometric evaluation before production.
5. **Voice Cloning Limitations:**
   - *Risk:* Spoken digit challenge-response mitigates static replay attacks, but does not defeat low-latency real-time generative voice cloning.

## 5. Next Recommended Step
Proceed to **Milestone 3B: Firebase ID-Token Verification & IoT Device Pre-Shared Key Middleware**:
1. Implement Firebase ID token verification dependency (`verify_firebase_user`) using `firebase-admin.auth`.
2. Implement IoT device token authentication dependency (`verify_device_token`) validating `X-Device-Key`.
3. Add ASGI raw-body size limiter middleware to protect Starlette multipart buffer.
4. Protect `/speakers`, `/challenge`, `/verify`, `/identify`, and `/ws/identify` according to the policy in `app/core/auth_policy.py`.
5. Add automated tests covering missing, invalid, expired, and revoked tokens, as well as unauthorized role access attempts.
